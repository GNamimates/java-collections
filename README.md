# My Quickie Java Snippets
the purpose of this repo is to hold snippets I can quickly copy paste onto my school works at ease, because making one from scratch every time takes time, and we only have a limited amount of time

dont expect anything good in here, its simply just to speed up my workflow, it just contains what my prof. wants us to use, not what I want to use.
